This is where I solve various TypeScript challenges ðŸš€

## Discriminated Unions vs. Unions

A discriminated union has something in common with whatever youâ€™re representing. For example, if youâ€™re working with an object you would have a common key.

```ts
// union
type B = "a" | "b" | "c";

// descriminated union
type A =
  | {
      type: "a";
      a: string;
    }
  | {
      type: "b";
      b: string;
    }
  | {
      type: "c";
      c: string;
    }

//enum
enum C {
  A = "a",
  B = "b",
  C = "c",
}
```
## Type Helpers
It's like a function which can recieve params and returns a result.

Type Helpers can receive a type and transform it

```ts
type Maybe<T> = T | undefined | null
```
